# UT Boot Camp PreWork - My Launching Point to Success!

## Description

Although building this webpage was part of my homework, I learned that I am really enjoying coding. I have wanted to take on computer programming for a long time, and I am finding an awesome time troubleshooting and debugging my code, as well as learning to use Git Hub, Git Bash, VSCode, and other tools. My son is a software engineer, and he has been instrumental in helping me solve issues. (Thank you very much, Jasper!!!) 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Each section included in my webpage contains notes about a certain topic I learned how to use, like: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. All of these were progressively more challenging to learn, but I look forward to these being second nature, soon! 
 
If you open the DevTools console in Chrome, you will see JavaScript running, and I used console to ensure my code was running correctly.

## Credits

Credit to Jasper Garcia, my son.
I also learned a ton from the UT Boot Camp Prework guide, and I searched Google, Bing, and used CoPilot AI to figure stuff out.
